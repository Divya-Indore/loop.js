// Write a program to find the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of a given set of numbers. The HCF is the largest number that divides all the given numbers without leaving a remainder.
// To do this, we'll ask the user to enter a value 'n' which represents the number of input numbers. Then, the user will input 'n' numbers. We'll calculate the HCF of these numbers.
// Can you Write a program to determine the HCF of 'n' given numbers?

// Test Case1:
// Input:
// 4
// 12
// 18
// 24
// 30
// Output:
// 6
// Explanation:
// In this test case, the user inputs four numbers: 12, 18, 24, and 30. The program then calculates the HCF of these numbers, which is found to be 6. This means that 6 is the largest number that can divide all the given numbers (12, 18, 24, and 30) without leaving a remainder.


let numbers = [12, 18, 24, 30];


let hcf = numbers[0];

for (let i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    let a = hcf;
    let b = numbers[i];

    while (b !== 0) {
        let temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }

    hcf = a;
}

console.log("HCF is: " + hcf);

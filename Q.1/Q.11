// Write a program to take a number from the user and then determine if that number is a special type of number called a 'perfect number'. A perfect number is a number where the sum of all its factors (excluding the number itself) is equal to the number itself.

// Test Case1:
// Input:
// 6
// Output:
// 6
// Explanation:
// The program takes the number 6 as input. It then calculates the factors of 6, which are 1, 2, and 3. The sum of these factors (1 + 2 + 3) is equal to 6, so 6 is a perfect number.

// Test Case2:
// Input:
// 12
// Output:
// 12
// Explanation:
// The program takes the number 12 as input. It calculates the factors of 12, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The sum of these factors (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6) is equal to 16, which is not equal to 12. Therefore, 12 is not a perfect number.


let num = 6;   
let sum = 0;

// find factors except the number itself
for (let i = 1; i < num; i++) {
    if (num % i === 0) {
        sum += i;
    }
}

if (sum === num) {
    console.log(num + " is a perfect number");
} else {
    console.log(num + " is not a perfect number");
}

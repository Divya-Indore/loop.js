// Write a program to print the first 'N' Fibonacci numbers. Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. We start with the numbers 0 and 1, and then calculate and print each subsequent Fibonacci number by adding the previous two numbers. For example, the third Fibonacci number is obtained by adding the first two numbers: 0 + 1 = 1. The fourth Fibonacci number can be obtained by adding the previous two numbers…
// if N=8 then the series will be (0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13)

let n = 8;
let a = 0 , b = 1,count = 2;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++){
    let c = a + b;
    a = b;
    b = c
    console.log(c)
}
